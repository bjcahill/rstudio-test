When the glory tries to tempt you
It may seem like what you need
But if glory makes you happy
Why are you so broken up?

from Get Your Wish by Porter Robinson

Hey you, let go of the whale
Let someone cut the breaks lose, let's get lost for real
I know that love will find a way to you, but would you trust me
If it took a leap of faith to make it real
Just let go of the wheel

from Let Go Of The Wheel by Mako
